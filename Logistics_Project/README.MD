# Formula 1 Logistics Optimization Project

## Overview

This project aims to optimize the logistics of the Formula 1 championship, with a focus on reducing carbon emissions and operational costs associated with race scheduling and transportation, while taking into account various realistic constraints, such as race scheduling rules and biding contracts, travel times between locations, the availability of different transportation modes (plane, ship, truck), climatic conditions and more, ensuring that the proposed solutions are feasible.

### Files:
1. **Formula_One_Logistics_Code.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with the optimization code using the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and CO2 minimization techniques.
2. **Final Report Formula 1 Logistics.pdf**: A detailed report analyzing the current logistics and presenting optimized solutions for reducing CO2 emissions and costs.
3. **Formula One Presentation.pdf**: A presentation summarizing the key findings and proposed logistics improvements.

## How to Use:
1. **Formula_One_Logistics_Code.ipynb**: Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the code to reproduce the optimization results.
2. **Final Report Formula 1 Logistics.pdf**: Refer to the report for a comprehensive analysis of the data, methods, and results.
3. **Formula One Presentation.pdf**: Use the presentation for a high-level summary of the projectâ€™s findings.
