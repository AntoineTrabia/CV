# GitHub CV

Welcome to my CV folder! This repository showcases some of my past projects to demonstrate my skills and experience in programming & data science. 

## Project 1: Logistics Project
This project consisted of optimizing the logistics of the Formula 1 championship, with a focus on reducing carbon emissions and operational costs associated with race scheduling and transportation, while taking into account various realistic constraints, such as race scheduling rules and biding contracts, travel times between locations, the availability of different transportation modes (plane, ship, truck), climatic conditions and more, ensuring that the proposed solutions are feasible.

## Project 2: Machine Learning Project
This project consisted of two elements: 
- **Competition**: We were provided 4,800 French sentences, each labelled with its corresponding difficulty level based on the CEFR scale (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2). In addition, we received a dataset of 1,200 French sentences for which we needed to predict the difficulty levels using machine learning techniques. The competition's goal was to achieve higher prediction accuracy than the other participants, which we did and thus won the competition.
- **App**: In addition to the competition we had to create an App using Streamlit. We developed 'Lyrical Lingo' an app designed to help French learners select songs that match their proficiency level. Our app estimates the overall difficulty level of a French song (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2) and assesses the difficulty of each sentence in the song. 'Lyrical Lingo' comes with a selection of preloaded songs, ranging from French classics to contemporary hits. Additionally, the app allows users to test the difficulty of their own song choices.
