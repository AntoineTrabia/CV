# GitHub CV

Welcome to my CV folder! This repository showcases some of my past projects to demonstrate my skills and experience in programming & data science. 

## Project 1: Machine Learning Project
This project consisted of two elements: 
- **Competition**: We were provided 4,800 French sentences, each labelled with its corresponding difficulty level based on the CEFR scale (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2). In addition, we received a dataset of 1,200 French sentences for which we needed to predict the difficulty levels using machine learning techniques. The competition's goal was to achieve higher prediction accuracy than the other participants, which we did and thus won the competition.
- **App**: In addition to the competition we had to create an App using Streamlit. We developed 'Lyrical Lingo' an app designed to help French learners select songs that match their proficiency level. Our app estimates the overall difficulty level of a French song (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2) and assesses the difficulty of each sentence in the song. 'Lyrical Lingo' comes with a selection of preloaded songs, ranging from French classics to contemporary hits. Additionally, the app allows users to test the difficulty of their own song choices.
  
## Project 2: Logistics Project
This project consisted of optimizing the logistics of the Formula 1 championship, with a focus on reducing carbon emissions and operational costs associated with race scheduling and transportation, while taking into account various realistic constraints, such as race scheduling rules and biding contracts, travel times between locations, the availability of different transportation modes (plane, ship, truck), climatic conditions and more, ensuring that the proposed solutions are feasible.

## Project 3: Data Science Project 
This project offers a comprehensive global analysis of the impact of surface temperature changes on potato crop yields from 1970 to the present. By examining historical climate data and agricultural outputs, the study investigates how rising temperatures and changing weather patterns have influenced crop productivity over time. The analysis highlights regional variations in temperature effects, identifies key periods of climate stress on crops, and provides insights into the long-term trends in agricultural resilience in the face of global warming. This work aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the intersection between climate change and food security.
