# GitHub CV

Welcome to my CV folder! This repository showcases some of my past projects to demonstrate my skills and experience in programming & data science. 

## Project 1: Machine Learning Project
This project consisted of two elements: 
- **Competition**: We were tasked with predicting the difficulty level of 1,200 French sentences using machine learning models. The training dataset consisted of 4,800 sentences, each labelled according to the CEFR scale (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2). The objective was to outperform other participants in prediction accuracy, which we successfully achieved, securing first place in the competition.
- **App Development**: In addition to the competition, we built a Streamlit app called Lyrical Lingo. This app helps French learners find songs suited to their language proficiency. It estimates the overall difficulty level of a French song and provides a detailed analysis of each sentence's complexity. The app includes a curated selection of songs, from French classics to modern hits, and also allows users to upload and analyze their own song choices.
  
## Project 2: Logistics Project
This project consisted of optimizing the logistics of the Formula 1 championship, with a focus on reducing carbon emissions and operational costs associated with race scheduling and transportation, while taking into account various realistic constraints, such as race scheduling rules and biding contracts, travel times between locations, the availability of different transportation modes (plane, ship, truck), climatic conditions and more, ensuring that the proposed solutions are feasible.

## Project 3: Data Science Project 
This project offers a comprehensive global analysis of the impact of surface temperature changes on potato crop yields from 1970 to the present. By examining historical climate data and agricultural outputs, the study investigates how rising temperatures and changing weather patterns have influenced crop productivity over time. The analysis highlights regional variations in temperature effects, identifies key periods of climate stress on crops, and provides insights into the long-term trends in agricultural resilience in the face of global warming. This work aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the intersection between climate change and food security.
