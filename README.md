# GitHub CV

Welcome to my CV folder! This repository showcases some of my past projects to demonstrate my skills and experience in programming & data science. 

## Project 1: Logistics Project
This project consisted of optimizing the logistics of the Formula 1 championship, with a focus on reducing carbon emissions and operational costs associated with race scheduling and transportation, while taking into account various realistic constraints, such as race scheduling rules and biding contracts, travel times between locations, the availability of different transportation modes (plane, ship, truck), climatic conditions and more, ensuring that the proposed solutions are feasible.

## Project 2: Machine Learning Project
